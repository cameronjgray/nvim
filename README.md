# Neovim Config

This is my current neovim config. Feel free to use it start your own. Just drop it into `.config/nvim` in your home folder if you're on some sort of Unix. If you're on Windows you can figure it out :wink:

It's based off of this YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) by the Primeagen on YouTube who does a lot of videos on Vim related content. You can see his repo [here](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua). My structure is the same but I've changed a few of the key mapping to what I prefer (as you should with Vim!).
