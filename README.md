# Neovim Config

This is my current neovim config. Feel free to use it start your own. Just drop it into `.config/nvim` in your home folder if you're on some sort of Unix. If you're on Windows you can figure it out :wink:

It is fairly minimalist, it uses Lazy package manager and uses the built in LSP. It's still a work in progress but it's now a step up from previous versions.

### Requirements
To use `<leader>nw` you need to install `ripgrep`
```
sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```
